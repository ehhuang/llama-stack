## This is WIP.

## Getting Started

Llama Stack UI is started by default when you run `llama stack run`.

If you want to start the UI server manually, you can do so with the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
